# Todo-api

Welcome to the todo api. Please take note of the following.

1.- The format for Http requests must follow the standard JSON type input with the next values:

      {
        "task": "task1",
        "deadline": "deadline1",
        "location": "location1"
      }
      
2.- The id is auto-generated using GUID. So for DELETE and PUT requests, please use the guid generated by the API.

3.- The server is found under the src directory, with the name server.js. It is advisable to run with node server.js to avoid any issues.
